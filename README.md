# The lyzeum2 AI class

In this repo we will host all notebooks, code, texts and other things used for the class.

The repo is connected to [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MischaPanch/lyzeum-ai-class/HEAD), 
you can run the notebooks directly. Just click on the logo and you're ready to go!
Have a quick look on the docu of [jupyterlab](https://jupyter.org/) to see how to work with the notebooks
and the corresponding compute environment.
